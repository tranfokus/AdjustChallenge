# Coding Challenge

test1.py is a python program to print the number from 1 to 10 in random number.

## Prerequisites
Before you run python script directly on your PC, please ensure to have installed any version of Python.
For the detail information about how to install Python (version 3) please take a look at (https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

## General usage information
To run the python script, follow these steps:
1. Download the script and save to your PC
2. Open a "Command Promt" (on Windows OS) or "Terminal" (on macOS) window and run the downloaded script

This script will run by simply typing python (or python3) followed by the file name of the script, e.g. python test1.py.
If the script is in a different directory from which you are trying to run it, you will need to provide the full path to the scriptâ€™s file.

```
python <full_path_to_script>
```
Alternatively you can run the script online by using any common web browser. Please access (https://repl.it/languages/python3), copy content of 'test1.py' and paste into the 'main.py' window
